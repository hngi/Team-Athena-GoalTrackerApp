                <h3>2. Use License</h3>
                <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on Athena's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

                    remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
                    transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.
                    This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Athena at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</p><br>
